# react-portfolio

## Description

I build this new portfolio as a way to have a more organized, better presenting porfolio about myself, projects, and skills. By doing this, I got to learn how to use React, as well as getting a better practice with bootstrap and styling. 


## Usage

Upon opening the portfolio webpage, you can click on either of the four tabs or at the footer of the page be redirected to the github profile, linkedin, or stackoverflow. When on the portfolio tab, if you hover on any of the images, the name of the website, repo link, and short description will appear. On the contact section, you are required to fill in the name, email, and message section otherwise you will get message saying it's required. The resume tab has a link in order to download the resume to view properly.
